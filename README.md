# RasPiOS-labwc

Wayfire is depreciated with the latest edition of the OS. Run any updates and run `sudo raspi-config`, go to 'Advanced -> Wayland' and select 'Labwc'. Clone the repo into a directory named ~/.config/labwc. Have a look at rc.xml for the keyboard shortcuts. I have 3 workspaces by default. If you edit rc.xml run `labwc --reconfigure` or use the shortcut provided.
